# PUSS! Debugger

A plugin for PUSS! that adds improvements and debugging features.

## Installation

This mod uses the **BepInEx** mod loader.

1. Download the [BepInEx v5.4.23.2](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2) for your target platform.
2. Download the latest release of PUSS! Debugger (coming soon).
3. Extract the contents of the BepInEx .zip file inside the root directory of the game, and launch the game at least once so that the required files are generated.
4. Place the PUSS! Debugger .dll file inside the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

You can configure additional settings for the plugin inside the `BepInEx/config/dev.saturnkai.pussdebugger.cfg` file.

If you are using a platform other than Windows, or you run into other issues installing BepInEx, additional documentation can be found [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html).
